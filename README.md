This is my personal website. The front-end server and back-end server are constructed by nginx and node respectively. 
The server is running on Amazon Ec2 ubuntu instance. The main purpose of this website is to display some projects I have done before. 
Beside, I hope to collect some data through the header you sent to me. The data is collected for research purpose on job 
searching, aiming to find out what companies are more likely to appreciate this type of effort. Thanks and enjoy:)
